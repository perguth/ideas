The Commons Deed is not a license. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the Legal Code (the full license) â€” it is a human-readable expression of some of its key terms. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to the Legal Code beneath. This Deed itself has no legal value, and its contents do not appear in the actual license.

Creative Commons (and d3v.at also) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services. Distributing of, displaying of, or linking to this Commons Deed does not create an attorney-client relationship.
